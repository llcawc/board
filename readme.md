# Board - Front-end Starter Template

Board uses Vite and the Vituum plugin as the front-end handler. For multi-page development, the [PUG](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) template language and [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) version 4 styles are used. Gulp is used for preprocessing fonts and images.

## Prerequisites

NodeJS dependencies need to be installed:

```
pnpm install
```

Working directories:

- For source code: `src` and `public`
- For compiled code: `dist` (folder will be created after running the "build" command)

## Commands

```

### Build for production environment

```
